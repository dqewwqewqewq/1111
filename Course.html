    <p>1. Java script：It is a lightweight, interpretive or just in time programming language with function priority. Although it is famous as a scripting language for developing web pages, it is also used in many non browser environments. JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language based on prototype programming and multi paradigm, and supports object-oriented, imperative, declarative and functional programming paradigms.Timeline：Basic operation（1-10day）Advanced operation（11-20day）Mixed use(21-30day).link：</p>
<button onclick="myFunction()">this</button>

<p>2. HTML：HTML refers to hyper text markup language. It is a simple markup language for making hypertext documents. It can be transplanted from one platform to another. It is usually used to make web pages. HTML file is ASCII text, including format tags and embedded code of hypertext chain.Timeline：Basic operation（1-10day）Advanced operation（11-20day）Mixed use(21-30day).link：</p>
<button onclick="myFunction()">this</button>
<p>3. CSS:Cascading style sheets (English full name: cascading style sheets) is a computer language used to represent file styles such as HTML (an application of Standard General Markup Language) or XML (a subset of Standard General Markup Language). CSS can not only modify the web page statically, but also format the elements of the web page dynamically with various scripting languages.Timeline：Basic operation（1-10day）Advanced operation（11-20day）Mixed use(21-30day).link：</p>

<p>4.C language：C language is a process oriented and abstract general programming language, which is widely used in the bottom development. C language can compile and process low-level memory in a simple way. C language is an efficient programming language that produces only a small amount of machine language and can run without any running environment support.Timeline：Basic operation（1-10day）Advanced operation（11-20day）Mixed use(21-30day).link：</p>
<button onclick="myFunction()">this</button>
<p>5.C + +:C + + can carry out procedural programming of C language, object-based programming characterized by abstract data types, and object-oriented programming characterized by inheritance and polymorphism. While C + + is good at object-oriented programming, it can also carry out process based programming.Timeline：Basic operation（1-10day）Advanced operation（11-20day）Mixed use(21-30day).link：</p>
<button onclick="myFunction()">this</button>
<p>6.Python：Python provides efficient high-level data structures and simple and effective object-oriented programming. Python syntax and dynamic types, as well as the essence of interpretive language, make it a programming language for scripting and rapid application development on most platforms. With the continuous updating of versions and the addition of new language functions, it is gradually used for the development of independent and large-scale projects.</p>
